Title: Tools for writing your whole bioinformatics workflow in R using `data.table`
Version: 0.1.0

Description: BioDT
    Do all your bioinformatics from R, using `data.table`.
    \
    WORK IS UNDERWAY converting our lab's raggedy but much beloved set of scripts into a more aerodynamic package suitable for public consumption.
    Represents common bioinformatics formats like fasta, bed, vcf, as `data.table`s with standardised columns, but which can be decorated or manipulated to the user's desire.
    Includes:
    - Read/write functions (e.g. fasta file ==> fasta data.table; bed data.table ==> bed file) and converters (e.g. alignment data.table ==> bed data.table)
    - Wrappers for common bioinformatics tasks that call linux tools like BLAST, vcf/bcftools, bedtools, samtools, seqtk, ...
    - Interfaces e.g. to pluck out chunks of [bv]cf files as data.tables, using syntax like `vcf.interface["chromosome",start,end]`
    - Various plotting and visualisation functions
    - Various convenience functions for bioinformatics tasks that keep cropping up again and again (`reverseComplement()`, `alleleFrequency()`, `suggestKaspMarkers()`, `setRefAlleleMostCommon()`, ...)
